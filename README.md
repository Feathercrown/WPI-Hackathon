# WPI-Hackathon
Yet another GRID attempt, for the WPI Hackathon this time.

# TODO
Reorganize server file structure
Fix game file recognition and loading
Rework client connection code
Create a text-based client
Provide just-in-time game creation
Game lifecycle - ready up, set up, play!
Game replays and archive?
Fix chess specifically (later? / in-depth task)
Server announcements API for the homepage
Server.log and server.error instead of using console directly, to allow logging etc.? Potentially the server should act on different errors automatically?
