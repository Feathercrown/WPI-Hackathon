# WPI-Hackathon
Yet another GRID attempt, for the WPI Hackathon this time.

# TODO
Provide just-in-time game creation
Game lifecycle - ready up, set up, play!
Fix chess specifically

# Maybe/Later TODOs
Server.log and server.error instead of using console directly, to allow logging etc.? Potentially the server should act on different   errors automatically?
Rework client connection code
Create a text-based client
Game replays and archive?
